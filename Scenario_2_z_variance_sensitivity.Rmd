title: "Comparing the effect of Z variability on model efficacy, when growth rates are taken from literature"

The .rmd demonstartes the effect of variation in Z on classic catch-curve methods and our size-distribution model with known G. To age the data a simple linear model is applied to size_sampled using a specificed G from the literature (0.21)
